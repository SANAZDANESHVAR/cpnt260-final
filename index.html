    <h1> Rose </h1>
    <p> The Rock Rose (Pavonia lasiopetala), also known as the Rose Mallow, is a great perennial for the California garden because of its drought tolerance and long flower bloom time.It will grow between 3-6 feet tall and wide and prefers well-drained rocky soils. Herbaceous stems rise from a woody base with pink hibiscus-like flowers and velvety, scalloped leaves. The Rock Rose is an excellent choice for your landscape because it is able to survive the summer heat, it grows easily, and has beautiful flowers that attract hummingbirds and butterfliesYarrow, (Achillea sp.), is found all throughout North America and is an american garden classic.</p>
    <br><h1> Rose </h1>
    <p> It grows to 3 feet tall with clustered flower heads at the top of the upwards shooting stems. The leaves are pinnately lobed and divided into smaller leaflets, giving them a delicate, fern-like, lacy appearance.</p>
    <br><h1> Rose </h1>
    <p> Different varieties come in variable heights and flower colors. Yarrow blooms from late April to early July in the southern part of the country, and prefers sun to part-shade. It has a high drought tolerance but likes to be watered every once and a while. This great little plant has been used ornamentally and medicinally for years and will continue to be a staple in the California garden</p>
